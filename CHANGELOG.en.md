# Changelog

English release notes start at 0.12.0. Earlier versions are described in Indonesian in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/melkimahdali/zusantara-core/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). `zusantara` and `create-zusantara` (before 0.12.10: `zentara` and `create-zentara`) always share the same version.

## [0.13.1]

### Added
- **Relations in the admin panel:** many-to-many through a join table (`many: { tags: { through: postTags } }`, detected by `make:admin`) with checkboxes in the form and tags in the list, and child records on the parent page (e.g. order items on the order page) with an add button that fills in the parent. [Documentation](https://zusantara.morixa.id/en/admin.html#relations).
- **Bulk data:** bulk actions with a count confirmation, CSV export that follows the filters, and CSV/Excel (.xlsx) import with column matching and a per-row preview before saving. The Excel reader has no outside dependencies.
- **Data history:** an audit log (who changed what, before and after) at `/admin/_log` and on the dashboard, per-record revision history with a diff and a restore button, soft delete with a trash, and an **Undo** button after a delete (also for tables without soft delete, from the copy in the log).
- **Content:** draft, published, and scheduled status with an automatic publish time and a preview button (`previewUrl`), unique automatic slugs, an SEO group for `meta*`/`seo*`/`og*` columns, two-language columns (`titleEn` beside `title`), a media library, and a site settings page read with `await admin.settings()`.
- **Workflows:** status transitions with per-role approvals (`workflow`), record and bulk custom actions that run code or a job (`actions`), internal notes per record, and a print/PDF page.
- **Automations** (`automations`): send an email, call a webhook, or run a job when a record is created, updated, or deleted, with a `when` condition.
- **Filter with a sentence** in Indonesian or English, e.g. "created this month, price above 100k", turned into normal filters in the URL.
- **Global search** across every admin table with **Ctrl+K**.
- **Change the schema without writing code:** `zusantara make:table` and `make:column` edit `schema.ts`, create and run the migration, and refresh the admin panel in one command. The `/admin/_schema` page (development only) does the same through a form with a preview and approval, and Zusantara AI uses it through the `zusantara` tool.
- `flash()` accepts a button (fourth argument), and `Toast` shows it. `testAdmin()` can send several values per field and files (multipart).
- `api` template: a site settings page at `/admin/_settings`.

### Removed
- Support for the old Zentara name: the `zentara` command, `zentara.config.*`, `ZENTARA_*` variables, `/_zentara/*` URLs, and the automatic `.zentara` folder move. The CLI shows a hint when a project still uses the old name; `zusantara migrate:zusantara` is still available, and the `zentara_jobs` queue table is still moved automatically.

## [0.13.0]

### Added
- **Admin panel (`zusantara/admin`) and `zusantara make:admin <table...> | --all`.** From the tables in your Drizzle schema it builds an admin dashboard (record counts and recent records per table), lists with search across several columns, filters by type (enum, boolean, date range), per-column sorting, pagination, create and edit forms, delete, and in-place editing in the table for enum and boolean columns. Relations use a `Combobox` with server-side search, and image/file columns use `FileInput` with a preview. [Documentation](https://zusantara.morixa.id/en/admin.html).
- **Safe to run again.** Only the `zusantara:generated` blocks are rewritten after the schema changes. A sha256 fingerprint on the block's opening line means hand edits inside a block are detected and not overwritten without `--force`.
- **Access per table and per action** (`view`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) with a list of roles, `true`/`false`, or a function. The Admin menu only shows for users who may view at least one table.
- **Secret columns** (password, hash, token, secret, salt, API key, OTP) never show in the panel, tests, or the manifest. Tables with a required column that cannot be filled from the form automatically cannot be added to from the panel.
- **Friendly database errors:** a unique value that is already taken shows on its field, and records still referenced elsewhere are not deleted. `beforeSave` can reject a save with `throw new AdminError(message, field)`, including in-place edits.
- `make:admin` also writes `test/admin-<table>.test.ts` using `testAdmin()`, which tests the panel with no server and no sign-in.
- `defineResource({ table, db })` without the generator: name, label, and fields are read from the schema.
- **`zusantara describe [--json]`:** an app manifest with routes, tables and columns (no secret columns), the admin panel and its access rules, jobs, and plugins, plus index suggestions for columns that are searched or filtered without an index.
- **htmx 2 in core** (0BSD, served from `/_zusantara/htmx.js`). `page()` loads it automatically when the markup uses `hx-*`. An `hx` prop on Button, PostButton, Form, Field, Select, Checkbox, Switch, Search, Tabs, and Pagination. Server helpers `isHtmx()`, `htmxTarget()`, `fragment()`, `hxRedirect()`, and `hxHeaders()`.
- **New UI kit components:** `DataTable` (per-column sorting with `aria-sort`, cards on phones), `InlineEdit`, `Combobox`, and `ComboboxOptions`. `NavItem` gains `badge`.
- Zusantara AI: the `zusantara` tool supports `make:admin` (undoable, test files included) and `describe`. The project summary mentions the admin panel, and the AI instructions cover the whole "add a status column to products" flow: schema, migration, `make:admin`, tests, then `view_page`.

### Changed
- `api` template: the hand-written `/admin/users` page is replaced by an admin panel generated by `make:admin` for the `users` and `notes` tables, with tests. Admins cannot remove their own admin role, and accounts are not deleted from the panel.
- Every admin page is sent with `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` and `Cache-Control: no-store`.
- `StatGroup` separators are now correct when boxes wrap to a new row on narrow screens.

### Compatibility
- Support for the old Zentara name (the `zentara` command, `zentara.config.*`, `ZENTARA_*`, `/_zentara/*`) is still there in 0.13.0 and is removed in 0.13.1. Run `zusantara migrate:zusantara` before then.

## [0.12.10]

### Changed
- **Zentara is now called Zusantara.** The name "Zentara" is already used by several other software companies and products, so the framework is renamed before 1.0. The npm packages are now `zusantara` and `create-zusantara`, the CLI command is `zusantara`, the config file is `zusantara.config.mjs`, environment variables are `ZUSANTARA_*`, the local data folder is `.zusantara/`, and internal URLs are `/_zusantara/*`. The repo moves to `melkimahdali/zusantara-core` and the docs to https://zusantara.morixa.id.
- **The license is now MIT** from this version (previously Business Source License 1.1). Versions 0.9.0 through 0.12.9 remain under BSL 1.1 as published. The name and logo are not covered by the code license, see `TRADEMARKS.md`.
- The Z logo stays the same.

### Added
- **`zusantara migrate:zusantara`** moves an existing project in one run: `zentara` and `zentara/...` imports, dependencies and scripts in `package.json`, `zentara.config.*`, `ZENTARA_*` in `.env`, and the `.zentara/` folder. Run `npm install` afterwards.

### Compatibility (0.12.x only, removed in 0.13)
- The `zentara` command still works as an alias of `zusantara`.
- `zentara.config.mjs` / `.js` is still loaded when there is no `zusantara.config.*`.
- `ZENTARA_*` variables are still read when the matching `ZUSANTARA_*` is not set.
- The project's `.zentara/` folder and `~/.zentara` move to `.zusantara/` automatically the first time the CLI runs (`.gitignore` is updated too).
- `/_zentara/*` URLs are still served, and the `zentara_jobs` queue table keeps working under the name `zusantara_jobs`.

## [0.12.9]

### Added
- **Request toolbar during `zentara dev`:** a small button next to the widget shows the page's processing time and query count, with an **N+1** mark when the same query runs three or more times. Its details list every query with its duration, the session contents (secret values hidden), and `console.log`/`warn`/`error` calls during the request. The last 50 requests can be read with `zentara requests [id] [--path] [--json]` and Zentara AI's `request_log` tool. Every response carries an `X-Zentara-Request` header.
- **Inspect mode:** the **⌖ Inspect** button shows the file and line of code that created the hovered element (`h()` records it as `data-zsrc` during development), and a click opens the chat about that element. `view_page` results also give this location per element (`← src/app/routes/x.ts:12`).
- **Page score** in `view_page` and `zentara view`: load time, size, request count, SEO meta (title, description, a single `h1`, `lang`), and basic accessibility (image alt, form labels, button and link names). `expect.minScore` and `--min-score` turn it into a requirement.
- **Check variants:** `viewport: "tablet"` (768×1024), `theme: "dark"`/`"light"`, and `lang: "en"`/`"id"` for one view only. CLI: `--tablet`, `--dark`, `--light`, `--lang`.
- **Screenshots:** `screenshot: true` and `zentara view --screenshot` capture a PNG with the Chrome, Chromium, or Edge already installed (or `CHROME_PATH`), saved in `.zentara/screenshots/`. Claude models receive it as an image; OpenAI-format providers get a note only.
- **Step recording:** the widget records the last 30 steps in the tab (pages, clicks, inputs without secret values, forms) and attaches them when you ask the AI, so bugs can be reproduced.
- **Automatic reload:** every app tab reloads after a file changes and the dev server is ready, except tabs with unsent form input. While a browser AI task runs, the reload waits.
- **Voice input** in the chat (widget, welcome page, error page) with `id-ID` or `en-US`, when the browser supports the Web Speech API.
- **New eval tasks:** `fix-n-plus-one` and `page-login-score` (31 tasks), with a `requests` check (no N+1, a query limit) and page checks `themes`, `langs`, `minScore`, and `noScoreFindings`.

### Changed
- The first line of a `view_page` result names the variant and score, e.g. `RESULT ok · browser · tablet · dark · 0 findings · score 95`.
- Nothing changes in production: no request traces, no `data-zsrc`, the `__zentara_*` parameters have no effect, and `/_zentara/dev/requests` answers 404 (checked by e2e).

## [0.12.8]

### Added
- **Public pages in the UI kit:** `Hero` (a photo beside it or centered), `FeatureGrid`, `MediaCard`, `Gallery`, `Pricing` (a featured plan, prices through `money()`), `Testimonial`, `FAQ` (plus FAQPage structured data for search engines), `CTA`, `LogoCloud`, `TeamCard`, and `ContactForm` (with a WhatsApp link).
- **Shop patterns:** `PriceTag` with a struck-through price, `ProductCard` (automatic discount label, rating, sold out), `QuantityInput` with − and + buttons (a plain number input without JavaScript), and `CartSummary` (subtotal, shipping, discount, total). Rupiah prices have no decimals.
- **Built-in sample images:** `placeholder("Chocolate cake", 800, 600)` returns a `/_zentara/placeholder.svg` URL for prototypes before real photos exist, with no internet needed.
- **Whole-page examples:** `landing`, `profile`, `store`, `booking`, and `dashboard`, each a complete route file in Indonesian and English built only from kit components. `zentara ui --example [name]` prints them, `/_zentara/ui/examples/<name>` shows them during `zentara dev`, and Zentara AI reads them through `ui_catalog` (the `example` parameter) as a starting point for public pages.
- The catalog has new *Public pages* and *Shop and business* groups. e2e checks all five examples with `view_page` in Chrome, on desktop and mobile, with two themes.
- **New eval tasks:** `page-landing-bakery`, `page-team-profile`, `page-booking-schedule`, and `theme-blue` (29 tasks). These public-page tasks require no AI-written CSS or `style` and passing layout checks on desktop and mobile. Grading them with a real model waits for the runner in Stage 15.

## [0.12.7]

### Added
- **Navigation in the UI kit:** `Navbar` for public pages (links and buttons move into a *Menu* on phones, no JavaScript), `Breadcrumb`, link-based `Tabs` (with `count`), `Pagination` (`href: "?page={page}"`, compact on phones), `Steps`, `DropdownMenu` (links or POSTs), a phone-only `BottomNav`, and `Footer`.
- **Dialogs and overlays:** `Dialog`, `ConfirmDialog` (a confirmation dialog that sends a POST), `Drawer`, `Sheet`, `Popover`, and `Tooltip`. They all use the browser's built-in `popover` attribute, so they open with `trigger: "Label"` or `h(Button, { opens: id })` and close with Esc or a click outside, without JavaScript. `Dialog({ open: true })` opens when the page loads.
- **Flash messages:** `flash(ctx, "Note saved.")` before a redirect and `h(Toast, { flash: takeFlash(ctx) })` on the target page. The message shows once and is stored in the session when `session()` is installed, otherwise in a short-lived `zen_flash` cookie. `Toast` disappears after 6 seconds.
- **More feedback:** `Progress` (with or without a value), `Spinner`, and `Skeleton`.
- **Data display:** `DescriptionList`, `Accordion` (`single: true` = one open at a time), `Timeline`, `Tag`, `AvatarGroup`, `Rating` (display, or a star input with `name`), `CodeBlock` with a *Copy* button, and a one-month `Calendar` with events for bookings and schedules (a list on phones). `Stat` gets `trend` and `change` for a colored up/down change.
- **Themed error pages:** in production, 403, 404, 500, and other statuses now use the UI kit with the app theme and name. `StatusPage` and `statusPage()` are available for your own status pages.
- The catalog has new *Navigation* and *Overlays* groups; every new component is in `zentara ui`, Zentara AI's `ui_catalog` tool, and the `/_zentara/ui` gallery, which e2e checks in Chrome (desktop and phone, two themes).

### Changed
- **The `api` template uses flash messages** for "Note saved", "Changes saved", and "Note deleted", instead of `?msg=` in the URL. Its test makes sure the message shows only once.
- The last word of the app name in `Brand` uses a slightly darker accent so it has enough contrast on grey backgrounds too (e.g. `Footer`).

## [0.12.6]

### Added
- **Layout primitives in the UI kit:** `Container`, `Stack`, `Row`, `Cluster`, `Columns`, `Section`, `Divider`, and `PageHeader` (breadcrumb, title, description, action buttons). Spacing and alignment are props with a fixed set of values (`gap: "none" | "xs" | "sm" | "md" | "lg" | "xl"`, `align`, `justify`), so pages line up on desktop and phones without CSS.
- **Complete forms:** `Select` (with groups and a `placeholder`), `Checkbox`, `CheckboxGroup`, `RadioGroup`, `Switch`, `FileInput`, and `Fieldset`. `Field` gains a prefix/suffix (`prefix: "$"`, `suffix: "kg"`), a *Show* button on passwords, and the `time`, `datetime-local`, `month`, `range`, and `color` types. `FileInput` takes the same `types` and `maxBytes` as `saveUpload()`, so the "Image, max. 5 MB" hint is written for you and a chosen image is previewed right away. `Form({ upload: true })` for multipart forms. Everything still works without JavaScript.
- **Theme in `zentara.config.mjs`:** `ui: { accent, radius, font, mode }`. The accent can be a name (`blue`, `rose`, …) or a hex, and is adjusted for light and dark mode automatically to keep WCAG AA contrast. `mode: "light"` or `"dark"` forces one mode. The theme is served at `/_zentara/theme.css` and only loaded when it differs from the default.
- **`zentara theme`** shows and changes the theme (`--accent blue --radius lg --font system --mode dark`, `--reset`), directly in `zentara.config.mjs`. The dev server reloads the config on its own.
- **Component catalog** generated from the UI kit's JSDoc (id/en): what each component is for, every prop with its type and allowed values, and an example. `zentara ui` prints it, `zentara ui Select` shows one component, `--json` for other tools.
- **`/_zentara/ui` gallery** during `zentara dev`: every component with a live example in the app's theme. It does not exist in production.
- **New AI flow for pages:** Zentara AI picks components from the catalog (the `ui_catalog` tool), arranges them with the layout primitives, then checks the page with `view_page`. Colors and fonts change through `zentara theme`, not CSS (undoable with `zentara undo`). When the kit is not enough, the AI explains the limit and offers custom CSS, which it only writes after you agree.
- e2e opens the gallery in Chrome and checks it with `view_page` on desktop and mobile, with the default theme and with another theme (blue, large radius, dark mode), so every new component gets its layout and contrast checked automatically.

### Changed
- New projects mention the `ui` option in `zentara.config.mjs`. The docs no longer suggest `<style>` to change colors.

### Fixed
- **UI kit contrast:** the text of `accent` and `gold` badges and the note under `Stat` now meet WCAG AA in light mode (previously 3.5 to 4.4:1). The gallery found them.
- **Layout checks no longer treat the content of a closed `<details>` as visible**, so a closed `Disclosure` no longer produces false "overlap" findings.

## [0.12.5]

### Added
- **Zentara AI chat on every page of your app** while running `zentara dev` or the interactive CLI. An **Ask Zentara AI** button floats in the bottom-right corner and works like the chat on the error page: request changes, see a diff with Approve/Reject, Undo changes, Stop, and New conversation. The conversation and panel state survive a page reload. The widget lives in a Shadow DOM, so the app's styles and the widget's styles never affect each other.
- **The AI can see the page.** Every message from the widget carries the current page: URL, the route file that serves it, the visible elements with their position and size, the text, console errors, and failed requests. Values of password fields, hidden fields, and fields marked `data-private` are never sent. The widget button shows how many console errors and failed requests the page has.
- **`view_page` tool for Zentara AI.** After changing a page, the AI opens it in your browser tab (in a hidden iframe, so the chat keeps running and your login cookie applies) and checks that it looks right, e.g. `{ url: "/notes", viewport: "mobile", expect: { text: ["Add"], selector: ["table"], noConsoleErrors: true, noLayoutIssues: true } }`. When no tab is open, the AI uses a text version from the server (no JavaScript) and says when the page needs a login.
- **Layout checks in `view_page`:** elements past the screen edge or causing sideways scrolling, overlapping elements, cut-off text, broken images, text contrast below WCAG AA, and `style` attributes, `<style>` elements, or pages outside the UI kit. Each finding names its element and the result names the route file. The text version checks what can be read from the HTML (custom CSS, UI kit, viewport meta, local images).
- **Desktop and mobile screens:** `viewport: "desktop"` (1280×800, the default) or `"mobile"` (390×844).
- **The AI must check the pages it changes.** After changing a page, typecheck and tests are followed by `view_page` on desktop and mobile. The AI fixes the findings in up to two attempts; if problems remain, the task ends as `verification_failed` with the findings instead of being reported as done. API routes are not checked, and neither is anything when the app server is not running.
- **Local AI task journal:** every Zentara AI task writes a summary to `.zentara/ai-tasks.jsonl` (status, steps, duration, tokens, typecheck, tests, and every `view_page`), without file contents or the conversation, and it never leaves your computer. `zentara ai:log [--limit 20] [--json]` shows it. The Stage 15 AI evals use this data. `AgentResult` gains `checks`.
- **`zentara view <path> [--mobile]`**: the same result as `view_page` in the terminal. When `zentara dev` or the interactive CLI runs and a browser tab is open, it uses that tab (through `.zentara/devtools.json`); otherwise the text version. `--text "a,b"` checks for text and `--json` prints JSON. It exits with 1 when there are findings or errors.
- **`zentara "<task>" --report <file>`**: the AI task result as JSON for evals and CI: status, steps, input/output tokens, model, tools called, fix attempts, rejected actions (including those rejected automatically in `--auto`), and duration. Without a file name it goes to `.zentara/ai-report.json`.
- **Zentara AI eval design** in `evals/`: 25 standard tasks on the `api` template with id and en prompts, injected bugs for fix tasks, and automatic grading checks. `node evals/validate-tasks.mjs` checks them without an API key. The runner and published results follow in Stage 15.

### Changed
- **The UI kit's light-mode accent is slightly darker (`#097e6b` instead of `#0b8a76`)** so white text on primary buttons and accent links on the page background meet the WCAG AA contrast of 4.5:1. The new layout check found this on the template's `/login` page.

### Fixed
- **Zentara AI verification no longer fails while the dev server runs.** The CLI process loads `.env` (e.g. `PORT=3000`), and `PORT` beats `port: 0` in tests, so the AI's `npm test` clashed with the dev server (`EADDRINUSE`) and verification always failed in the interactive CLI and the browser chat. The AI's typecheck and test scripts now run without `PORT` and the development server variables. The AI smoke test checks this flow from the widget.

### Security
- **The widget only exists during development, with nothing to remove by hand.** The app server injects it only when debug mode is on, the app was started by the development server (`ZENTARA_DEV=1`, set automatically by `zentara dev`), and `NODE_ENV` is not `production`. `zentara start` also removes the development server variables from the environment. In production, `/_zentara/dev/*` answers 404 and HTML is left untouched. The e2e tests check this, including when the devtools variables leak into the environment and `ZENTARA_DEBUG=1` is set.
- The widget scripts are files (`/_zentara/dev/probe.js`, `/_zentara/dev/widget.js`), not inline scripts. HTML fragments (without `<html>`/`<body>`) and htmx requests (`HX-Request`) are left alone.

## [0.12.4]

### Added
- **End-to-end tests for real-world use**, so bugs like the ones in 0.12.2 are caught in CI (Ubuntu & Windows) before a release:
  - **Global CLI:** zentara installed with `npm install -g` without drizzle-orm. After a new table and route are added, `db:generate`, `db:migrate`, `routes`, and `jobs` run from the global CLI in the api project.
  - **Zentara AI tools from the global install:** `list_routes` reads new routes and schema exports right away in the same process, `database generate/migrate` runs through the project's zentara, and so does the `zentara jobs` tool.
  - **Interactive flow:** on first open, the language is asked first and saved. "Create a new project" with a name containing spaces produces a safe folder, installs dependencies, and uses the chosen language template.
- `ZENTARA_CREATE_PACKAGE` and `ZENTARA_CREATE_ARGS` to test "Create a new project" with local packages.

## [0.12.3]

### Fixed
- **Creating a project from the interactive CLI no longer "exits" Zentara.** Previously the Zentara screen closed and the terminal was handed to `npm create zentara`, which then asked everything again in the plain terminal ("Ok to proceed?", template, dependencies, OmniRoute). Now:
  - the folder name and template are asked inside Zentara;
  - `create-zentara` and `npm install` run in the background without questions, with progress in the spinner;
  - when done, Zentara opens in the new project right away;
  - **Esc** cancels project creation and removes the half-created folder. If it fails, the error is shown and you stay in Zentara.
- Project folder names are made safe: spaces and other characters become `-` (e.g. "hub tiket transportasi" becomes `hub-tiket-transportasi`). A folder that already has files is never overwritten.
- **Language selection stays:** the first time `zentara` opens (no language chosen yet via `ZENTARA_LANG`, `locale` in the config, or `zentara lang`), it asks for the language first and saves it to `~/.zentara/settings.json`; *Create a new project* also asks for the app language (the current language is highlighted).
- **Database commands from the global CLI no longer fail on drizzle-orm.** `zentara db:generate`, `db:migrate`, and `db:seed`, including the ones Zentara AI runs in the terminal and in the browser, now use the project's own zentara (`node_modules/zentara`), which has drizzle-orm and drizzle-kit. If the project's dependencies are missing, the message says so clearly: run `npm install`.
- **Zentara AI's `list_routes` always reads the latest code.** Routes are loaded in a fresh process, so routes and schema that were just changed (e.g. a new `bookings` table) no longer fail with "does not provide an export named ..." because of a stale module cache.

### Added
- **A `zentara` tool for Zentara AI**, so the AI can run every CLI function (terminal and browser) with the project's own zentara:
  - `routes` and `jobs` run right away without approval;
  - `make:route`, `make:middleware`, `make:job`, and `build` are asked in ask mode, and files created by `make:*` can be reverted with `zentara undo`;
  - `jobs:run` always asks for approval.

  The AI is also told to stop asking the developer to run these commands themselves.

## [0.12.2]

### Fixed
- **Zentara AI reuses the app's existing layout** when asked to build a page, instead of inventing its own design.
  - The project summary sent to the AI now names `src/app/lib/ui.ts` and its exports (`appPage`, `APP_NAME`, ...), one example page that already uses `appPage()`, and the route list.
  - The AI's instructions require `appPage()` for signed-in pages and `page()` for public pages, ask it to read a similar page first, add new pages to the `navFor()` menu, and forbid its own `<html>`, `<style>`, CSS, or navigation unless asked.
  - When `write_file`/`edit_file` writes a route that builds its own HTML document or CSS, the tool result adds a note so the AI fixes it right away.
- The `api` and `minimal` templates no longer ship a `zenstyles/` folder (an old, differently styled stylesheet no page used, which confused the AI). `loadZenStyles()` is deprecated but kept for existing projects; there, the AI is told not to use it.

### Added
- Roadmap: htmx joins stage 12, and an optional plugin catalog that Zentara AI can offer as choices joins stage 15.

## [0.12.1]

### Fixed
- **The interactive CLI no longer leaves old output behind.** Full screen now uses the terminal's alternate screen (`\u001b[?1049h`), so earlier output (e.g. `npm create zentara` and `npm install`) is hidden and can't be scrolled to. On exit, the normal screen returns and the conversation recap is printed to the scrollback. Other processes started from the CLI (creating a project, installing OmniRoute) write to the normal screen, and the full screen is redrawn afterwards.
- **The terminal tab title** becomes *zentara* while the CLI is open (Ink and `--classic`), and is restored on exit.

### Changed
- **A framed header with the logo**, like Claude Code: a small Z logo (teal and gold), name & version, tagline, AI status, and folder on the left; command tips and the dev server status on the right when the terminal is wide enough. Short terminals get a compact two-line header.

## [0.12.0]

Stage 10 (English) and stage 11 (back-end) ship together. Indonesian stays the default; existing projects keep working as before, apart from the changes listed below.

### Added
- **Zentara in English.** Every text in the CLI (Ink and classic), `ai:setup`, Zentara AI, the welcome/error/404 pages, built-in error messages, the `zentara/ui` kit, and `create-zentara` is available in `id` and `en`. The catalogs are typed: a key missing in either language is a TypeScript error.
  - Choose with `zentara lang en` (global, `~/.zentara/settings.json`), `/lang en` in the interactive CLI, `locale: "en"` in `zentara.config.mjs`, or the `ZENTARA_LANG` env.
  - Zentara AI replies in the user's language and writes app texts in the project's `locale`. Tool descriptions for the model are now in English.
  - UI kit: `money()`, `formatNumber()`, and `formatDate()` use `Intl` for the language; `page({ lang })` for a single page.
  - `npm create zentara` asks for the language first, or pass `--lang en`. The `api` and `minimal` templates come in both languages with identical code (enforced by tests).
  - English documentation at https://zentara-core.morixa.id/en/ with a language switcher, bilingual npm READMEs, and these English release notes.
- **Background jobs & cron schedules.** Every file in `src/app/jobs/` is a job; queue it with `enqueue(name, data, { delay, runAt, retries })`.
  - The queue is stored in SQLite (`data/jobs.db`), survives restarts, and is safe across several processes; failed jobs are retried after 10 seconds, 20 seconds, ... up to 1 hour.
  - `export const schedule = "0 7 * * *"` runs a job on a cron schedule (5 fields, day/month names, `@daily` and friends), once per minute even with several servers.
  - CLI: `zentara make:job <name> [--schedule]`, `zentara jobs [--json]`, `zentara jobs:run <name> [--data]`. The `jobs` config and the `ZENTARA_JOBS=off` env.
  - Tests: the queue lives in memory when `NODE_ENV=test`, and `jobs.drain()` runs every job that is due.
- **Email with `sendMail()`**: built-in SMTP without dependencies (STARTTLS, `smtps://`, AUTH PLAIN/LOGIN), attachments, cc/bcc. Configure with `MAIL_URL`/`MAIL_FROM` or the `mail` config. During development emails are printed to the log and saved in `.zentara/mail/`; in tests they are collected in `outbox`; in production without `MAIL_URL` it throws.
- **File uploads** with `readForm()` (multipart/urlencoded/JSON as `FormData`) and `saveUpload()`: random file names, the type from the extension, dangerous extensions rejected, image/PDF contents checked, size limits. `readInput()` now reads multipart too.
- **In-memory cache**: `cache.get/set/has/delete/clear(prefix)` and `cache.remember(key, ttl, fn)` (concurrent requests compute once), plus `MemoryCache` with TTL and an LRU limit.
- `api` template: a `welcome-email` job that sends a welcome email after sign-up, with a test.
- New docs: Jobs & schedules, Email, File uploads, Cache, and Language.

### Changed
- The classic CLI (`--classic`) now runs on the same host as the Ink CLI, so both always behave the same.
- `api` template: the delete-note route is now `/notes/:id/delete`, and URL messages use neutral codes (`?msg=created`, `?new=1`) so they match in both languages.
- The `zentara` and `create-zentara` READMEs are shorter, bilingual, and point to the documentation site.
